### User Interface — React

If any JavaScript project has taken the front-end ecosystem by storm in recent years, that would be
React.
React is a library built and open-sourced by the smart people at Facebook. In React,
developers write components for their web interface and compose them together.
Advantages of React JS

✓ It boosts productivity and facilitates further maintenance.

✓ It ensures faster rendering.

✓ It guarantees stable code.

✓ It is SEO friendly.

✓ It is backed by a strong community.

### State Management — Redux

Redux is a popularly known open-source JavaScript library that facilitates state management in
applications.
We concluded to use this library for state management due to the following:

✓ It increases the Predictability of a State.

✓ It is Highly Maintainable.

✓ The probability of re-renders is reduced substantially.

✓ Redux Optimizes Performance.

✓ It makes Debugging Easier.

✓ It is useful in Server-Side Rendering.

✓ It provides Ease of Testing.

### Coding with Style — CSS Modules

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are rules to describe how the HTML elements look. We concluded to
use SASS (preprocessor), Tailwind CSS (framework), and Bootstrap(framework)

➢ SASS - We considered using this CSS extension for styling due to the following:

✓ It facilitates writing clean, easy, and less CSS in a programming construct.

✓ It contains fewer codes, so we can write CSS quicker.

✓ it is compatible with all versions of CSS, so we can use any available CSS libraries.

✓ it allows nesting, so we can use nested syntax and useful functions like color manipulation, math functions, and other values.

➢ TAILWIND - We also consider using this library for styling due to the following:

✓ It saves time

✓ we don’t have to write and maintain huge piles of CSS from scratch.

✓ No more media queries

✓ We don’t have to create separate media query files to make our component responsive.

✓ Tailwind by default provides 5 different breakpoints.

➢ BOOTSTRAP - is an open-source framework made by twitter. We considered adopting Bootstrap
for the following reasons:

✓ It makes designing a lot simpler and you don't have to worry too much about how your site
looks like on different browsers because the framework already takes care of that.

✓ It saves a lot of time. Bootstrap is all about making designs responsive without media
queries.

### Package Management — NPM

NPM stands for Node.JS Package Manager. NPM shipped with Node.js. NPM is the middle service
that connects projects with dependencies. We concluded its preference due to the following:

✓ It is the best package management system for JavaScript.

✓ It has a great community.

✓ Stability.

✓ It's super-fast and has more packages than other competitors.

### Convention — BEM

BEM – meaning block, element, and modifier – is a front-end naming methodology. We consider
adopting the BEM convention for the following reasons:

✓ We can quickly identify which modifiers and children an existing component already has if we
wish to create a new style for it. We might even come to the conclusion that there is already a

modifier that does what we require, negating the necessity for us to write any CSS in the first
place.

✓ For simpler team communication, designers and developers can consistently name components.
In other words, BEM provides a declarative syntax that everyone on a project may use to stay in
sync.

✓ If BEM conventions are strictly followed, it will become easy to update and add to existing CSS in
the future, with the full confidence that new changes will not have side effects.
